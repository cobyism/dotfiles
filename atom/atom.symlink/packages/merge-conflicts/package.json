Additionally, it displays your progress through a merge.\n\n## Features\n\n * Conflict resolution controls are provided for each detected conflict.\n * Choose your version, their version, combinations thereof, or arbitrary changes edited in place as a resolution.\n * Navigate to the next and previous conflicts in each file.\n * Track your progress through a merge with per-file progress bars and a file list.\n * Save and stage your resolved version of each file as it's completed.\n\n## Events\n\nThe merge-conflicts plugin emits a number of events that other packages can subscribe to, if they wish. If you want your plugin to consume one, use code like the following:\n\n```coffeescript\natom.on 'merge-conflicts:resolved', (event) ->\n```\n\n * `merge-conflicts:resolved`: broadcast whenever a conflict is resolved. `event.file`: the absolute path of the file in which the conflict was found; `event.total`: the total number of conflicts in that file; `event.resolved`: the number of conflicts that are resolved, including this one.\n * `merge-conflicts:staged`: broadcast whenever a file has been completed and staged for commit. `event.file`: the absolute path of the file that was staged.\n * `merge-conflicts:quit`: broadcast when you stop merging conflicts by clicking the quit button.\n * `merge-conflicts:done`: broadcast when all conflicts in all files have successfully been resolved.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributors are welcome! I'm a big believer in [the GitHub flow](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/), and the [Atom package contribution guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/contributing) is a solid resource, too.\n\nHere's the process in a nutshell:\n\n 1. Fork it. :fork_and_knife:\n 2. Run `apm develop merge-conflicts` from your terminal to get a clone of this repo. By default, this will end up in a subdirectory of `${HOME}/github`, but you can customize it by setting `${ATOM_REPOS_HOME}`.\n 3. Fix up your remotes. The convention is to have `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` pointing to this repo.\n\n Assuming you set up your username using [the local GitHub Config Convention](https://github.com/blog/180-local-github-config)\n\n ```bash\n $ git config --global github.user your_username\n ```\n\n You can set your remotes up with something like:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd ${ATOM_REPOS_HOME:-~/github}/merge-conflicts\n   git remote rename origin upstream\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:`git config github.user`/merge-conflicts.git\n   ```\n\n 4. Create a branch and work on your awesome bug or feature! Commit often and consider opening a pull request *before* you're done. Follow the style and conventions of existing code and be sure to write specs!\n 5. Get it merged. Profit :dollar:\n",
